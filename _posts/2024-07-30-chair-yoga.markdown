description: Enjoy the effects of yoga without pressure on the wrists, knees and back. If you are dealing with an injury, a chronic condition or simply do not like getting down on the floor, this is the class for you. Options will be given so all students can participate regardless of physical challenges. During the seven-week sessions, each class will include breathwork, stretching and meditation.
